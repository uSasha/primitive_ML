# primitive_ML
Main goal is to implement basic but usable machine learning stack of algirithms and helper functions.
I will keep it simple with minimum options and lines of code. I use MSE loss function in most cases.

### Linear models:
- linear regression without regularization
- Ridge (L2 regulirized) regression

### Tree based models:
- decision tree
- random forest
- gradient tree boosting

### Clusterisation:
- k means
- k nearest neighbors classifier
- k nearest neighbors regression

### Bayes classification:
- for multinomial features
- for continuous features (Gaussian distribution)

### Anomaly detection
- isolation forest
