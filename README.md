# primitive_ML
Basic implementation of machine learning algorithms, 
Main goal is to implement basic but usable machine learning stack of algirithms and helper functions.
I will keep it simple with minimum options and lines of code.

### Linear models:
- linear regression without regularization
- Ridge (L2 regulirized) regression

### Tree based models:
- descision tree
- random forest
